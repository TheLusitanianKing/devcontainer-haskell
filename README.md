# Basic VSCode dev container setup for Haskell
See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers for more information about dev containers.

This comes with:
- GHC
- Cabal
- `hlint`
- and `stylish-haskell`

Everything is installed through GHCup and it should be pretty easy to adapt to your needs.

# N.B.
At the moment, there's no official Haskell dev container configuration but if this ever change, please use the official setup.
