# Basic VSCode dev container setup for Haskell
See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers for more information about dev containers.

This comes with:
- GHC (through GHCup)
- Cabal (through GHCup)
- `hlint`
- and `stylish-haskell`

It should be pretty easy to adapt to your needs but let me know if I can help.

# N.B.
At the moment, there's no official Haskell dev container configuration but if this ever changes, please use the official setup.
