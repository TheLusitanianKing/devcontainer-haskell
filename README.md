# VSCode dev container for Haskell
Basic VSCode's dev container setup for Haskell.

Comes with:
- GHC
- Cabal
- `hlint` and `stylish-haskell`

Everything is installed through GHCup and should be pretty easy to adapt to your needs.

# N.B.
At the moment, there's no official Haskell dev container configuration.
If this ever change in the future, please use the official one.
